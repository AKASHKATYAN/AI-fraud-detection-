AI-Based Public Fraud Detection System

Domain: Artificial Intelligence (Cross-Sector)
Use Case: Government Spending, Procurement, Welfare & Contract Audits

Traditional audits are manual, rule-based, and reactive, leading to delayed detection of fraud and misuse.

This project presents an AI-powered fraud and anomaly detection system that:

Detects suspicious transactions automatically

Assigns risk scores for audit prioritization

Provides explainable AI insights

Offers an interactive dashboard for auditors

Works even without any uploaded dataset (built-in large sample data)
